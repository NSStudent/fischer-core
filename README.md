`FischerCore` is a Swift library that encapsulates the core logic and data structures necessary for building chess games.
Named in honor of the legendary chess grandmaster **Bobby Fischer**, this library provides a comprehensive foundation for creating, managing, and enforcing the rules of chess

## References

This library is based on the code of other well-crafted chess engines and bitboard libraries in Swift. Notably, it builds upon the work in [Sage by @nvzqz](https://github.com/nvzqz/Sage/tree/develop), adapting and updating it to be compatible with the current state of the Swift language and modern development practices.
